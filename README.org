* Test Exercise for [[https://internship.neolab.io/][NEOLAB Internship]]

All examles are shown for *nix, for Windows use ~gradlew.bat~ instead of ~gradlew~

** To build application.

~$ gradlew build~

Results into ~./bin/~ directory as *.class files

** To run application. 

~$ gradle run~

But nothing happens, because App only creates class instances, no other logic.

** To test application.

~$ gradle test~

Here 3 test: ~AppTest~, ~StringProcessorTest~, ~RomeNumberCreatorTest~

For tests used JUnit 4.

All tests passes successfully.

~$ gradlew Javadoc~ 

Results into ~./build/doc/javadoc/~ directory

** To create jar with all dependecies.

~$ gradlew fatJar~
